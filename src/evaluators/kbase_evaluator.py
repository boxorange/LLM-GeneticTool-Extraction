Yet, a comprehensive and integrated view of these fundamental processes is lacking. Here, we describe an image-based quantitative screen of the single-gene knockout collection of Escherichia coli, and identify many new genes involved in cell morphogenesis, population growth, nucleoid (bulk chromosome) dynamics and cell division. Functional analyses, together with high-dimensional classification, unveil new associations of morphological and cell cycle phenotypes with specific functions and pathways. Additionally, correlation analysis across ~4,000 genetic perturbations shows that growth rate is surprisingly not predictive of cell size. Growth rate was also uncorrelated with the relative timings of nucleoid separation and cell constriction. Rather, our analysis identifies scaling relationships between cell size and nucleoid size and between nucleoid size and the relative timings of nucleoid separation and cell division. These connections suggest that the nucleoid links cell morphogenesis to the cell cycle."

            The paper describes the development of arabinose-inducible artificial transcription factors (ATFs) using CRISPR/dCas9 and Arabidopsis-derived DNA-binding proteins to control gene expression in E. coli and Salmonella. The authors demonstrate the utility of these ATFs by engineering a Salmonella biosensor strain that responds to the presence of alkaloid drugs with quantifiable fluorescent output and by controlling Î²-carotene biosynthesis in E. coli. The ATFs are derived from widely different DNA-binding domains (DBDs) and are expressed using the arabinose-inducible araBAD promoter (PBAD). The ATFs target their binding sites (BSs) located upstream of a weak synthetic promoter, which results in the expression of the target gene. The authors also optimize the arabinose induction system in Salmonella by genetically modifying the L-arabinose (arabinose) catabolic pathway and defining an optimal 'arabinose induction window' that results in high heterologous gene expression with minimal effects on bacterial growth. The authors further establish an arabinose-inducible CRISPR/dCas9-derived ATF library in Salmonella and evaluate a novel class of ATFs with heterologous DBDs based on plant-specific transcription factors (TFs) from Arabidopsis thaliana combined with the SoxS AD. The authors also characterize the dose-dependency of arabinose-based gene expression from plasmid and chromosome in S. Typhimurium LT2 and perform growth curve analyses to determine the optimal conditions for arabinose-inducible gene expression. The authors also demonstrate the utility of the ATFs by engineering a Salmonella strain to function as a sensitive biosensor for alkaloid drugs and an E. coli strain as a microbial cell factory to produce Î²-carotene.

Here, we describe an image-based quantitative screen of the single-gene knockout collection of Escherichia coli, and identify many new genes involved in cell morphogenesis, population growth, nucleoid (bulk chromosome) dynamics and cell division. Functional analyses, together with high-dimensional classification, unveil new associations of morphological and cell cycle phenotypes with specific functions and pathways. Additionally, correlation analysis across ~4,000 genetic perturbations shows that growth rate is surprisingly not predictive of cell size. Growth rate was also uncorrelated with the relative timings of nucleoid separation and cell constriction. Rather, our analysis identifies scaling relationships between cell size and nucleoid size and between nucleoid size and the relative timings of nucleoid separation and cell division. These connections suggest that the nucleoid links cell morphogenesis to the cell cycle."
