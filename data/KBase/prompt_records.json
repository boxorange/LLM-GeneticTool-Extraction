However, in the case of two intramolecular lox sites, their relative orientation dictates the Cre-dependent outcome: the lox flanked DNA is inverted if the sites converge or diverge, whereas the segment is excised if the lox sites have the same direction."}, {"id": "60_236", "label": "cloning method", "start_offset": 351, "end_offset": 355, "entity": "CPEC", "which_text": "sent_with_neighbors", "text": "The RFP module was generated by a 2 step Page | 36 process.

Under constant exposure to harsh environmental threats, terrestrial Antarctica remains home to a great diversity of microorganisms, indicating that the soil bacteria must have adapted a range of survival strategies that require cell-to-cell communication. Survival strategies include secondary metabolite production, biofilm formation, bioluminescence, symbiosis, conjugation, sporulation and motility, all of which are often regulated by quorum sensing (QS), a type of bacterial communication. Up to now, such mechanisms have not been explored in terrestrial Antarctica. Here, for the first time, LuxI/LuxR-based quorum sensing (QS) activity was delineated in soil bacterial isolates recovered from Adams Flat, in the Vestfold Hills region of East Antarctica. Interestingly, we identified the production of potential homoserine lactones (HSLs) ranging from medium to long chain length in 19 bacterial species using three biosensors, namely Agrobacterium tumefaciens NTL4, Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 and Escherichia coli MT102, in conjunction with thin layer chromatography (TLC). The majority of detectable HSLs were from gram-positive microorganisms not previously known to produce HSLs. This discovery further expands our understand of the microbial community capable of this type of communication, as well as providing insights into physiological adaptations of microorganisms that allow them to survive in the harsh Antarctic environment. IMPORTANCE Quorum sensing, a type of bacterial communication, is widely known to regulate many processes including those that confer survival advantage.

Many of these kits were designed with specific industrial or laboratory microbes in mind. For researchers interested in non-model microbial systems, it is often unclear which tools and techniques will function in newly isolated strains. To address this challenge, we designed the Pathfinder toolkit for quickly determining the compatibility of a bacterium with different plasmid components. Pathfinder plasmids combine three different broad-host-range origins of replication with multiple antibiotic resistance cassettes and reporters, so that sets of parts can be rapidly screened through multiplex conjugation. We first tested these plasmids in Escherichia coli, a strain of Sodalis praecaptivus that colonizes insects, and a Rosenbergiella isolate from leafhoppers. Then, we used the Pathfinder plasmids to engineer previously unstudied bacteria from the family Orbaceae that were isolated from several fly species. Engineered Orbaceae strains were able to colonize Drosophila melanogaster and could be visualized in fly guts.

However, mechanisms that underlie reovirus hematogenous spread remain undefined. Non-structural protein \u03c31s is a critical determinant of reovirus bloodstream dissemination that is required for efficient viral replication in many types of cultured cells. Here, we used the specificity of the \u03c31s protein for promoting hematogenous spread as a platform to uncover a role for lymphatic type-1 interferon (IFN-1) responses in limiting reovirus systemic dissemination. We found that replication of a \u03c31s-deficient reovirus was restored to wild-type levels in cells with defective type-1 interferon a-receptor (IFNAR1) signaling. In vivo, reovirus spreads systemically following oral inoculation of neonatal mice, whereas the \u03c31s-null virus remains localized to the intestine. We found that \u03c31s enables reovirus spread in the presence of a functional IFN-1 response, as the \u03c31s-deficient reovirus disseminated comparably to wild-type virus in IFNAR1-/- mice. Lymphatics are hypothesized to mediate reovirus spread from the intestine to the bloodstream. IFNAR1 deletion from cells expressing lymphatic vessel endothelium receptor-1 (LYVE-1), a marker for lymphatic endothelial cells, enabled the \u03c31s-deficient reovirus to disseminate systemically. Together, our findings indicate that IFN-1 responses in lymphatics limit reovirus dissemination. Our data further suggest that the lymphatics are an important conduit for reovirus hematogenous spread. IMPORTANCE Type-1 interferon (IFN-1) responses are a critical component of the host response to viral infections. However, the contribution of specific cell and tissue types to control of viral infections is not known. Here, we found that reoviruses lacking nonstructural protein were more sensitive to IFN-1 responses than wild-type reovirus, indicating that \u03c31s is important for reovirus resistance to IFN-1 responses. The \u03c31s protein also is a key determinant of reovirus systemic spread. We used tissue-specific IFNAR1 deletion in combination with the IFN-1-sensitive \u03c31s-null reovirus as a tool to identify a role for lymphatics in reovirus dissemination. We used Cre-lox technology to delete type-1 interferon a-receptor (IFNAR1) in lymphatic cells and found that the IFN-1-sensitive \u03c31s-deficient reovirus disseminated in mice with lymphatic endothelial cells-specific deletion of IFNAR1.

Due to their outsized importance in pathogenesis, VLG products are attractive targets for the next generation of antimicrobials. However, precise manipulation of VLG expression in the context of infection is technically challenging, limiting our ability to understand the roles of VLGs in pathogenesis and accordingly design effective inhibitors. We previously developed a suite of gene knockdown tools that are transferred by conjugation and stably integrate into pathogen genomes that we call \u201cMobile-CRISPRi\u201d. Here we show the efficacy of Mobile-CRISPRi in controlling VLG expression in a murine infection model. We optimize Mobile-CRISPRi in Pseudomonas aeruginosa for use in a murine model of pneumonia by tuning the expression of CRISPRi components to avoid non-specific toxicity. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that knockdown of a VLG encoding the type III secretion system (T3SS) activator ExsA blocks effector protein secretion in culture and attenuates virulence in mice. We anticipate that Mobile-CRISPRi will be a valuable tool to probe the function of VLGs across many bacterial species and pathogenesis models. Importance Antibiotic resistance is a growing threat to global health. To optimize the use of our existing antibiotics and identify new targets for future inhibitors, understanding the fundamental drivers of bacterial growth in the context of the host immune response is paramount. Historically these genetic drivers have been difficult to manipulate, as they are requisite for pathogen survival. Here, we provide the first application of Mobile-CRISPRi to study virulence life-style genes in mouse models of lung infection through partial gene perturbation.

Results SVM achieved a high predicting accuracy of 93.07% in 10-fold cross validation for classification of promoters\u2019 transcriptional functions. Laplacian eigenmap (spectral embedding) based on editing distance may not be capable for extracting discriminative features for this task.

Two prevalent systems used for the efficient elimination of the expression of specific genes are the Cre-LoxP system and the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Here we present a simple method that combines the use of CRISPR-Cas9 and Cre-loxP for the conditional deletion of essential genes in mammalian cells. First, an inducible Cre recombinase is stably expressed in the cells. Next CRISPR-Cas9 is used to knockout an essential gene, whose function is complemented by stable expression of a FLAG-tagged version of the same protein encoded from a floxed transcription unit containing silent mutations, making it refractory to the CRISPR-Cas9 guide. This FLAG-tagged protein can be deleted by activating the expressed Cre protein enabling evaluation of the cellular consequences of its deletion.

Here, we report SYMBIOSIS, a versatile method that can robustly manipulate DNA parts in vivo and in vitro. First, we proposed a \u201cKeys match Locks\u201d model to demonstrate that three orthogonal serine integrases are able to irreversibly and stably switch on seven synthetic biobricks with high accuracy in vivo. Then, we demonstrated that purified integrases can facilitate the assembly of \u201cDonor\u201d and \u201cAcceptor\u201d plasmids in vitro to construct composite plasmids. Finally, we used SYMBIOSIS to assemble different chromoprotein genes and create novel colored Escherichia coli. We anticipate that our SYMBIOSIS strategy will accelerate synthetic biobricks manipulation, genetic circuit design, and multiple plasmids assembly for synthetic biology with broad potential applications."}, {"id": "103_1678", "label": "not relevant", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 15, "entity": "Single-molecule", "which_text": "title", "text": "Single-molecule tracking reveals the functional allocation, in vivo interactions and spatial organization of universal transcription factor NusG"}, {"id": "104_1679", "label": "not relevant", "start_offset": 773, "end_offset": 782, "entity": "endosomal", "which_text": "abstract", "text": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are promising tools to transfer macromolecular therapeutic molecules to recipient cells, however, efficient functional intracellular protein delivery by EVs remains challenging. Here, we have developed novel and versatile systems that leverage selected molecular tools to engineer EVs for robust cytosolic protein delivery both in vitro and in vivo. These systems, termed VSV-G plus EV-sorting Domain-Intein-Cargo (VEDIC) and VSV-G-Foldon-Intein-Cargo (VFIC), exploit an engineered mini-intein (intein) protein with self-cleavage activity to link cargo to an EV-sorting domain and release it from the EV membrane inside the EV lumen. In addition, we utilize the fusogenic protein VSV-G to facilitate endosomal escape and cargo release from the endosomal system to the cytosol of recipient cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that the combination of the self-cleavage intein, fusogenic protein and EV-sorting domain are indispensable for efficient functional intracellular delivery of cargo proteins by engineered EVs. As such, nearly 100% recombination and close to 80% genome editing efficiency in reporter cells were observed by EV-transferred Cre recombinase and Cas9/sgRNA RNPs, respectively. Moreover, EV-mediated Cre delivery by VEDIC or VFIC engineered EVs resulted in significant in vivo recombination in Cre-LoxP R26-LSL-tdTomato reporter mice following both local and systemic injections. Finally, we applied these systems for improved treatment of LPS-induced systemic inflammation by delivering a super-repressor of NF-\u0138B activity. Altogether, this study describes a platform by which EVs can be utilized as a vehicle for the efficient intracellular delivery of macromolecular therapeutics for treatments of disease. Graphic summary: Development of VEDIC and VFIC systems for high-efficiency intracellular protein delivery in vitro and in vivo Intein in tripartite fusion protein (EV-sorting Domain-Intein-Cargo) performs C-terminal cleavage during the process of EV-biogenesis, resulting in enriched free cargo proteins inside of vesicles. Together with fusogenic protein, VSV-G, these engineered EVs achieve high-efficiency intracellular delivery of cargo protein (Cre and super repressor of NF-\u0138B) or protein complex (Cas9/sgRNA RNPs) both in reporter cells and in mice models."}, {"id": "105_469", "label": "plasmid", "start_offset": 610, "end_offset": 622, "entity": "pBbS8c-mRFP1", "which_text": "sent_with_neighbors", "text": "The magnet insert was amplified by PCR, followed by a PCR cleanup before being included in a golden gate reaction with the expression library to create the final split protein library.

Guided by the sequence features learned from natural promoter sequences, our framework could explore the potential sequences effectively and design brand new synthetic promoters in silico. Specifically, Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) based model were used to design promoters with high activity, and their activities were further tested in vivo. As a result, more than 45% of the artificial promoters were demonstrated to be functional and shared no significant sequence similarity with neither natural promoters nor the E. coli genome.

We have recently expressed an exogenous protease as a way of gaining control over endogenous protein levels, including carboxysomal components, in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcous elongatus PCC 7942. By utilizing this system, proteins that compose the carboxysome can be tuned in real-time as a method to examine carboxysome dynamics. Yet, analysis of subtle changes in carboxysome morphology with microscopy remains a low-throughput and subjective process. Here we use deep learning techniques, specifically a Rotationally Invariant Variational Autoencoder (rVAE), to analyze the fluorescence microscopy images and quantitatively evaluate how carboxysome shell remodelling impacts trends in the morphology of the microcompartment over time. We find that rVAEs are able to assist in the quantitative evaluation of changes in carboxysome location, shape, and size over time.

To overcome these obstacles, we developed an efficient method for multiple gene disruption in C. higginsianum by combining CRISPR-Cas9 and URA3-based marker recycling systems. Our method significantly increased the efficiency of gene knock-out via homologous recombination by introducing genomic DNA double-strand breaks.

Cell-free transcription-translation-based metabolic engineering strategies have been previously used to optimise several different biosynthetic pathways but not the polyhydroxyalkanoates biosynthetic pathways. Here we have developed several Escherichia coli cell-free transcription-translation-based systems for in vitro prototyping of polyhydroxyalkanoates biosynthetic operons, and also for screening relevant metabolite recycling enzymes. These cell-free transcription-translation reactions were customised through the addition of whey permeate, an industrial waste that has been previously used as a low-cost feedstock for optimising in vivo polyhydroxyalkanoates production. We found that the inclusion of an optimal concentration of whey permeate enhanced relative cell-free GFPmut3b production by ~20% compared to control reactions that did not include whey permeate. An analysis of pH in our cell-free reactions suggests that the observed increase in GFPmut3b production was likely through enhanced ATP generation, as a consequence of the glycolytic processing of lactose present in whey permeate. We also found that whey permeate enhanced cell-free reactions produced ~3\u03bcM (R)-3HB-CoA, whilst, coupled cell-free biotransformation/transcription-translation reactions produced a ten-fold greater yield of (R)-3HB-CoA. These reactions were also used to characterise a Clostridium propionicum propionyl CoA transferase enzyme that can recycle Acetyl-CoA.

These structural and biochemical studies have suggested that conformational changes and DNA bending in presynaptic complexes underlie site-selection and activation mechanisms of Cre recombinase. Here we used protein engineering and various DNA substrates to isolate the Cre-loxP (54 kDa), Cre2-loxP (110 kDa), and Cre4-loxP2 assembly intermediates, and determined their structures using cryo-EM to resolutions of 3.9 \u00c5, 4.5 \u00c5, and 3.2 \u00c5, respectively. Progressive DNA bending along the assembly pathway enables formation of increasingly intimate protein-protein interfaces. Insufficient stabilization of important protein motifs observed during the assembly process provides a compelling explanation for the observed half-the-sites activity, and preferential bottom strand cleavage of loxP sequences. We found that selection of loxP sites is largely dependent on Cre\u2019s ability to bend and stabilize the spacer region between two recombinase binding elements. Application of 3D variability analysis to the tetramer data reveals a propensity for motion along the pathway between protomer activation and Holliday junction isomerization. These findings help us to better understand loxP site specificity, controlled activation of alternating protomers, the basis for the observed bias of strand cleavage order, and the importance of conformational sampling, especially with regards to site-selection and activity among Cre variants. Furthermore, our findings provide invaluable information for the rational development of designer, site-specific recombinases for use as gene editing technologies. Highlights Cryo-EM structures of Cre-loxP assembly intermediates (monomer, dimer, and tetramer) provide insights into mechanisms of site recognition, half-the-sites activity, strand cleavage order, and concerted strand cleavage Selectivity of loxP sites arises from few base-specific contacts made by each protomer and is mainly driven by formation of phosphate contacts and DNA deformations that are maximal in the fully assembled \u201cactive\u201d tetramer Cis and trans interactions of the \u03b22-3 loop (i) define which sites are \u201cactive\u201d and (ii) ensure half-the-sites activity Protein flexibility plays a central role in enabling DNA sequence scanning, recruitment of a second protein to form a dimer, synapsis, control of activity, as well as subsequent recombination steps Conformational sampling within the tetrameric complex was uncovered using 3D variability analysis and revealed the importance of protein-protein interfaces for site- selection and activation of Cre-loxP complexes\n"}, {"id": "155_1777", "label": "organism host", "start_offset": 472, "end_offset": 489, "entity": "Escherichia coli.", "which_text": "abstract", "text": "Bacteria are versatile living systems that enhance our understanding of nature and enable biosynthesis of valuable chemicals.

These structural and biochemical studies have suggested that conformational changes and DNA bending in presynaptic complexes underlie site-selection and activation mechanisms of Cre recombinase. Here we used protein engineering and various DNA substrates to isolate the Cre-loxP (54 kDa), Cre2-loxP (110 kDa), and Cre4-loxP2 assembly intermediates, and determined their structures using cryo-EM to resolutions of 3.9 \u00c5, 4.5 \u00c5, and 3.2 \u00c5, respectively. Progressive DNA bending along the assembly pathway enables formation of increasingly intimate protein-protein interfaces. Insufficient stabilization of important protein motifs observed during the assembly process provides a compelling explanation for the observed half-the-sites activity, and preferential bottom strand cleavage of loxP sequences. We found that selection of loxP sites is largely dependent on Cre\u2019s ability to bend and stabilize the spacer region between two recombinase binding elements. Application of 3D variability analysis to the tetramer data reveals a propensity for motion along the pathway between protomer activation and Holliday junction isomerization. These findings help us to better understand loxP site specificity, controlled activation of alternating protomers, the basis for the observed bias of strand cleavage order, and the importance of conformational sampling, especially with regards to site-selection and activity among Cre variants. Furthermore, our findings provide invaluable information for the rational development of designer, site-specific recombinases for use as gene editing technologies.

In type I TA, synthesis of the toxin protein is prevented by the transcription of an antitoxin RNA during normal growth. Here, we report the characterization of five additional type I TA systems present within phiCD630-1 and phiCD630-2 prophage regions of C. difficile 630. Toxin genes encode 34 to 47 amino acid peptides and their ectopic expression in C. difficile induces growth arrest. Growth is restored when the antitoxin RNAs, transcribed from the opposite strand, are co-expressed together with the toxin genes. In addition, we show that type I TA modules located within the phiCD630-1 prophage contribute to its stability and mediate phiCD630-1 heritability. Type I TA systems were found to be widespread in genomes of C. difficile phages, further suggesting their functional importance. We have made use of a toxin gene from one of type I TA modules of C. difficile as a counter-selectable marker to generate an efficient mutagenesis tool for this bacterium.

These structural and biochemical studies have suggested that conformational changes and DNA bending in presynaptic complexes underlie site-selection and activation mechanisms of Cre recombinase. Here we used protein engineering and various DNA substrates to isolate the Cre-loxP (54 kDa), Cre2-loxP (110 kDa), and Cre4-loxP2 assembly intermediates, and determined their structures using cryo-EM to resolutions of 3.9 \u00c5, 4.5 \u00c5, and 3.2 \u00c5, respectively. Progressive DNA bending along the assembly pathway enables formation of increasingly intimate protein-protein interfaces. Insufficient stabilization of important protein motifs observed during the assembly process provides a compelling explanation for the observed half-the-sites activity, and preferential bottom strand cleavage of loxP sequences. We found that selection of loxP sites is largely dependent on Cre\u2019s ability to bend and stabilize the spacer region between two recombinase binding elements. Application of 3D variability analysis to the tetramer data reveals a propensity for motion along the pathway between protomer activation and Holliday junction isomerization.

Treatment typically involves a combination therapy of two antibiotics administered for several weeks to month, but despite this harsh treatment relapses occur at a rate of 5-15%. Although poor compliance and reinfection may account for a fraction of the observed relapse cases, it is apparent that the properties of the infectious agent itself may play a decisive role in this phenomenon. Methodology/Principal findings We used B. abortus carrying a dual reporter in a macrophage infection model to gain a better understanding of the efficacy of recommended therapies in cellulo. For this we used automated fluorescent microscopy as a prime read-out and developed specific CellProfiler pipelines to score infected macrophages at the population and the single cell level. Combining microscopy of constitutive and induced reporters with classical CFU determination, we quantified the protective nature of the Brucella intracellular niche to various antibiotics and the ability of B. abortus to persist in cellulo despite harsh antibiotic treatments. Conclusion/Significance We demonstrate that treatment of infected macrophages with antibiotics at recommended concentrations fails to fully prevent growth and persistence of B. abortus in cellulo, which may be explained by a protective nature of the intracellular niche. Moreover, we show the presence of bona fide intracellular persisters upon antibiotic treatment, which are metabolically active and retain the full infectious potential, therefore constituting a plausible reservoir for reinfection and relapse. In conclusion, our results highlight the need to extend the spectrum of models to test new antimicrobial therapies for Brucellosis to better reflect the in vivo infection environment, and to develop therapeutic approaches targeting the persister subpopulation. Authors Summary Brucellosis is a zoonosis endemic to many low- and middle-income countries around the world. Recommended therapies by the WHO are comprised of at least two antibiotics for several weeks, sometimes month. Despite these harsh treatments relapses are frequent. The underlying reasons for these relapses, besides reinfection and non-compliance to treatment, are unknown. Our study shows that Brucella abortus can form so called \u201cpersisters\u201d under recommended treatments in rich broth but also inside macrophages. This small bacterial subpopulation survives antibiotic treatment and resumes growth after removal of the antibiotics and could therefore serve as a reservoir for relapses in human Brucellosis. Furthermore, we show that the macrophage intracellular niche of Brucella has protective properties against recommended antibiotics as observed for other intracellular pathogens, highlighting the necessity to develop new infection models to assess antibiotic efficacy."}, {"id": "204_701", "label": "RBS", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 33, "entity": "Ba_B0034", "which_text": "sent_with_neighbors", "text": "The BioBricks used were BBa_B0034 (ribosome binding site, RBS), BBa_K206000 (pBAD), BBa_K145015 (GFP with lva-tag), BBA_B0015 (transcriptional terminator) and BBa_C0062 (luxR).

This trait is thought to contribute to the ability of E. faecium to spread among patients in hospitals. Because there is currently a lack of data on the mechanisms that are responsible for the ability of E. faecium to survive in the absence of nutrients, we performed a high-throughput transposon mutant library screening (Tn-seq) to identify genes that have a role in long-term survival during incubation in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 20\u00b0C. A total of 18 genes were identified by Tn-seq to contribute to survival in PBS, with functions associated with the general stress response, DNA repair, metabolism, and membrane homeostasis. The gene which was quantitatively most important for survival in PBS was usp (locus tag: EfmE745_02439), which is predicted to encode a 17.4 kDa universal stress protein. After generating a targeted deletion mutant in usp, we were able to confirm that usp significantly contributes to survival in PBS and this defect was restored by in trans complementation. As usp is present in 99% of 1644 E. faecium genomes that span the diversity of the species, we postulate that this gene is a key determinant for the remarkable environmental robustness of E. faecium. Further mechanistic studies into usp and other genes identified in this study may shed further light on the mechanisms by which E. faecium can survive in the absence of nutrients for prolonged periods of time."}, {"id": "209_1848", "label": "not relevant", "start_offset": 153, "end_offset": 163, "entity": "primordial", "which_text": "title", "text": "A single intracellular protein governs the critical transition from an individual to a coordinated population response during quorum sensing: Origins of primordial language"}, {"id": "210_1849", "label": "not relevant", "start_offset": 94, "end_offset": 107, "entity": "Mitochondrial", "which_text": "title", "text": "Genomics of Preaxostyla Flagellates Illuminates Evolutionary Transitions and the Path Towards Mitochondrial Loss"}, {"id": "211_767", "label": "promoter", "start_offset": 110, "end_offset": 114, "entity": "pOMD", "which_text": "sent_with_neighbors", "text": "2002) as a control.

We demonstrate that fusing an FKBP12-derived destabilizing domain to Cas9 (DD-CAS9) enables conditional Cas9 expression in vitro in the presence of an FKBP12 synthetic ligand and temporal control of gene-editing.

Here, we measured cobalamin riboswitch activity in vivo using a Bacillus subtilis fluorescent reporter system and found that among 38 tested riboswitches, a subset responded to corrinoids promiscuously, while others were semi-selective. Analyses of chimeric riboswitches and structural models indicate that, unlike other riboswitch classes, cobalamin riboswitches indirectly differentiate among corrinoids by sensing differences in their structural conformation.

As the brain is organized into neural networks, it is critical to understand how anatomically connected structures are affected by genome editing. For example, neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) project to the striatum, and the striatum contains neurons that project to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr). Methods Here, we report the effect of injecting genome editors into the striatum of Ai14 reporter mice, which have a LoxP-flanked stop cassette that prevents expression of the red fluorescent protein tdTomato. Two weeks following intracerebral delivery of either synthetic nanocapsules (NCs) containing CRISPR ribonucleoprotein targeting the tdTomato stop cassette or adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors expressing Cre recombinase, the brains were collected, and the presence of tdTomato was assessed in both the striatum and SN. Results TdTomato expression was observed at the injection site in both the NC- and AAV-treated groups and typically colocalized with the neuronal marker NeuN. In the SN, tdTomato-positive fibers were present in the pars reticulata, and SNpr area expressing tdTomato correlated with the size of the striatal genome edited area.

Despite the availability of genomic and transcriptomic information and the ability to transform both organisms, identifying C. higginsianum genes involved in virulence has been challenging due to their recalcitrance to gene targeting and redundancy of virulence factors. To overcome these obstacles, we developed an efficient method for multiple gene disruption in C. higginsianum by combining CRISPR-Cas9 and URA3-based marker recycling systems. Our method significantly increased the efficiency of gene knock-out via homologous recombination by introducing genomic DNA double-strand breaks. We demonstrated the applicability of the URA3-based marker recycling system for multiple gene targeting in the same strain. Using our technology, we successfully targeted two melanin biosynthetic genes, SCD1 and PKS1, which resulted in deficiency in melanisation and pathogenicity in the mutants.

Lacking a licensed vaccine, or specific therapeutics, control of ZIKV transmission focuses on vector control. However, in most transmission settings, current methods are insufficient to successfully control ZIKV, or other similarly-transmitted arboviruses such as dengue and chikungunya viruses. This has stimulated interest in genetics-based methods, either to reduce the number of mosquitoes (\u201cpopulation suppression\u201d), or to make mosquitoes less able to transmit (\u201cpopulation modification\u201d). Here, we describe a method to selectively eliminate infected mosquitoes, using a virus sensor inserted into the mosquito genome and coupled to a quorum-counting lethal effector. In mosquitoes, ZIKV normally establishes persistent, lifelong infection; survival of these infected mosquitoes is crucial to transmission potential. Correspondingly, removal of infected mosquitoes can reduce vectorial capacity of a mosquito population, i.e. ability to transmit. Since relatively few mosquitoes become infected, typically <2%, engineered hypersensitivity to ZIKV would have only a modest population-level fitness cost, and lower still if transmission were successfully reduced by such means."}, {"id": "245_1891", "label": "plasmid", "start_offset": 153, "end_offset": 158, "entity": "pNivC", "which_text": "sent_with_neighbors", "text": "Assembly of synthetic operons and expression plasmids was performed as described before 47, 80.

Meiotic recombination is initiated by programmed double-strand break (DSB) formation that in budding yeast takes place in gene promoters and is promoted by histone H3K4 di/trimethylation. This histone modification is recognized by Spp1, a PHD-finger containing protein that belongs to the conserved histone H3K4 methyltransferase Set1 complex. During meiosis, Spp1 binds H3K4me3 and interacts with a DSB protein, Mer2, to promote DSB formation close to gene promoters. How Set1 complex- and Mer2- related functions of Spp1 are connected is not clear. Here, combining genome-wide localization analyses, biochemical approaches and the use of separation of function mutants, we show that Spp1 is present within two distinct complexes in meiotic cells, the Set1 and the Mer2 complexes. Disrupting the Spp1-Set1 interaction mildly decreases H3K4me3 levels and does not affect meiotic recombination initiation. Conversely, the Spp1-Mer2 interaction is required for normal meiotic recombination initiation, but dispensable for Set1 complex-mediated histone H3K4 methylation. Finally, we evidence that Spp1 preserves normal H3K4me3 levels independently of the Set1 complex. We propose a model where the three populations of Spp1 work sequentially to promote recombination initiation: first by depositing histone H3K4 methylation (Set1 complex), next by \u201creading\u201d and protecting histone H3K4 methylation, and finally by making the link with the chromosome axis (Mer2-Spp1 complex). This work deciphers the precise roles of Spp1 in meiotic recombination and opens perspectives to study its functions in other organisms where H3K4me3 is also present at recombination hotspots. Author summary Meiotic recombination is a conserved pathway of sexual reproduction that is required to faithfully segregate homologous chromosomes and produce viable gametes. Recombination events between homologous chromosomes are triggered by the programmed formation of DNA breaks, which occur preferentially at places called hotspots. In many organisms, these hotspots are located close to a particular chromatin modification, the methylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3). It was previously shown in the budding yeast model that one protein, Spp1, plays an important function in this process. We further explored the functional link between Spp1 and its interacting partners, and show that Spp1 shows genetically separable functions, by depositing the H3K4me3 mark on the chromatin, \u201creading\u201d and protecting it, and linking it to the recombination proteins. We provide evidence that Spp1 is in three independent complexes to perform these functions. This work opens perspectives for understanding the process in other eukaryotes such as mammals, where most of the proteins involved are conserved."}, {"id": "247_1897", "label": "not relevant", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 43, "entity": "parameters", "which_text": "title", "text": "Optimization of the experimental parameters of the ligase cycling reaction"}, {"id": "248_1898", "label": "genome engineering", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 65, "entity": "Cre recombinase", "which_text": "title", "text": "Unloxing the assembly and activation mechanism of Cre recombinase using Cryo-EM"}, {"id": "248_1899", "label": "genome engineering", "start_offset": 466, "end_offset": 474, "entity": "Cre-loxP", "which_text": "abstract", "text": "Mechanistic understanding of the structural basis for DNA recombination in the Cre-loxP system has largely been guided by crystallographic structures of tetrameric synaptic complexes (intasomes). These structural and biochemical studies have suggested that conformational changes and DNA bending in presynaptic complexes underlie site-selection and activation mechanisms of Cre recombinase. Here we used protein engineering and various DNA substrates to isolate the Cre-loxP (54 kDa), Cre2-loxP (110 kDa), and Cre4-loxP2 assembly intermediates, and determined their structures using cryo-EM to resolutions of 3.9 \u00c5, 4.5 \u00c5, and 3.2 \u00c5, respectively. Progressive DNA bending along the assembly pathway enables formation of increasingly intimate protein-protein interfaces. Insufficient stabilization of important protein motifs observed during the assembly process provides a compelling explanation for the observed half-the-sites activity, and preferential bottom strand cleavage of loxP sequences. We found that selection of loxP sites is largely dependent on Cre\u2019s ability to bend and stabilize the spacer region between two recombinase binding elements. Application of 3D variability analysis to the tetramer data reveals a propensity for motion along the pathway between protomer activation and Holliday junction isomerization. These findings help us to better understand loxP site specificity, controlled activation of alternating protomers, the basis for the observed bias of strand cleavage order, and the importance of conformational sampling, especially with regards to site-selection and activity among Cre variants. Furthermore, our findings provide invaluable information for the rational development of designer, site-specific recombinases for use as gene editing technologies. Highlights Cryo-EM structures of Cre-loxP assembly intermediates (monomer, dimer, and tetramer) provide insights into mechanisms of site recognition, half-the-sites activity, strand cleavage order, and concerted strand cleavage Selectivity of loxP sites arises from few base-specific contacts made by each protomer and is mainly driven by formation of phosphate contacts and DNA deformations that are maximal in the fully assembled \u201cactive\u201d tetramer Cis and trans interactions of the \u03b22-3 loop (i) define which sites are \u201cactive\u201d and (ii) ensure half-the-sites activity Protein flexibility plays a central role in enabling DNA sequence scanning, recruitment of a second protein to form a dimer, synapsis, control of activity, as well as subsequent recombination steps Conformational sampling within the tetrameric complex was uncovered using 3D variability analysis and revealed the importance of protein-protein interfaces for site- selection and activation of Cre-loxP complexes\n"}, {"id": "249_1900", "label": "not relevant", "start_offset": 80, "end_offset": 96, "entity": "Gammaherpesvirus", "which_text": "title", "text": "Lytic Replication and Reactivation from B Cells Is Not Required for Maintaining Gammaherpesvirus Latency in vivo"}, {"id": "250_795", "label": "plasmid", "start_offset": 360, "end_offset": 365, "entity": "pBbAk", "which_text": "sent_with_neighbors", "text": "The plasmids used for OptoCreVvd2 expression are derived from Sheets et al.51 For bla activation studies, we changed the plasmid selection cassette from bla to cat, using the gene from the BglBrick plasmids34 and primers listed in Table S1.

With the redesign of metabolic pathways, it is possible to create connections for the implementation of new organisms that carry out functions that are normally not present in nature. From a computational point of view, metabolic pathways, which can be found in data sources as KEGG, can be converted to a graph data structure.

The present work aims to design a tool for the transformation of metabolic pathways and the development of path finding algorithms that establish relevant links between compounds that are essential to the biofuel production process.

Modern cloning techniques allow easy assembly of synthetic genetic constructs from discrete cis-regulatory modules. However, it is unclear how much the contributions of CREs to gene expression depend on other CREs in the host gene. Using budding yeast, we probe the extent of composability, or independent effects, of distinct CREs. We confirm that the quantitative effect of a terminator on gene expression depends on both promoter and coding sequence. We then explore whether individual cisregulatory motifs within terminator regions display similar context dependence, using transcriptomewide datasets of mRNA decay. To test the extent of composability, we construct reporter genes consisting of combinations of motifs within various terminator contexts, paired with different promoters. Our results show that the effect of a motif on RNA abundance depends both on its host terminator, and also on the associated promoter sequence.

The precise mechanism of action of these PBD monomers and their role in causing DNA damage remains to be elucidated. Here we characterized the damage-inducing potential of two C8-linked PBD bi-aryl monomers in Caulobacter crescentus and investigated the strategies employed by cells to repair the same. We show that these compounds cause DNA damage and efficiently kill bacteria, in a manner comparable to the extensively used DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin-C (MMC). However, in stark contrast to MMC which employs a mutagenic lesion tolerance pathway, we implicate essential functions for error-free mechanisms in repairing PBD monomer-mediated damage. We find that survival is severely compromised in cells lacking nucleotide excision repair and to a lesser extent, in cells with impaired recombination-based repair. Loss of nucleotide excision repair leads to significant increase in double-strand breaks, underscoring the critical role of this pathway in mediating repair of PBD-induced DNA lesions.

There is thus an urgent need to mechanistically characterize the traits that contribute to the emergence of E. faecium as a multidrug resistant opportunistic pathogen. A fundamental part of research into E. faecium biology relies on the ability to generate targeted mutants, but this process is currently labour-intensive and time-consuming, taking 4 to 5 weeks per mutant. In this report we describe a method relying on the high recombination rates of E. faecium and the application of the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 genome editing tool to more efficiently generate targeted mutants in the E. faecium chromosome. Using this tool and the multi-drug resistant clinical E. faecium strain E745, we generated a deletion mutant in the lacL gene, which encodes the large subunit of the E. faecium \u03b2-galactosidase. Blue/white screening using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) could be used to distinguish between the wild-type and lacL deletion mutant. We also inserted two copies of gfp into the intrinsic E. faecium macrolide resistance gene msrC to generate stable green fluorescent cells. We conclude that CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to generate targeted genome modifications in E. faecium in 3 weeks, with limited hands-on time.

As we develop a better understanding of how these communities interact together, as well as with their host organisms, there is growing interest in engineering communities with specific functions, such as for treating disease, personalized probiotics, or aiding plants with nutrient uptake.

Where experimental approaches for monitoring metabolites are limited, computational tools can enable greater access to the fate of both chemicals and microbes within a community. In this study, we developed a computerized model of a synthetic microbial community of two bacteria, one which performs photosynthesis and supplies sugar and another which consumes the sugar for growth. We showed that the relative level of sugar secretion regulates not only the steady-state support for the consumer partner\u2019s growth, but also how the community changes with time.

We found that some of the critical parameters for fitness prediction were inter-colony distance, initial biomass, induction level, and distance from the center of the simulation volume. We anticipate that the synergy between experimental and computational approaches will improve our ability to design consortia with novel function. Author Summary Microbial communities, play important, yet poorly understood roles in health and agriculture. As we develop a better understanding of how these communities interact together, as well as with their host organisms, there is growing interest in engineering communities with specific functions, such as for treating disease, personalized probiotics, or aiding plants with nutrient uptake. To better understand how these microbes interact with each other, we want to monitor the exchange of metabolites and the locations of the microbes, tasks which at present are technically challenging, if not impossible. Where experimental approaches for monitoring metabolites are limited, computational tools can enable greater access to the fate of both chemicals and microbes within a community. In this study, we developed a computerized model of a synthetic microbial community of two bacteria, one which performs photosynthesis and supplies sugar and another which consumes the sugar for growth. We showed that the relative level of sugar secretion regulates not only the steady-state support for the consumer partner\u2019s growth, but also how the community changes with time. To determine the importance of spatial organization within the community, we fit a model and used it to predict colony growth. We anticipate that the synergy between experimental and computational approaches will improve our ability to design microbial communities with new functions."}, {"id": "285_1944", "label": "not relevant", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 55, "entity": "cavefish", "which_text": "title", "text": "CaveCrawler: An interactive analysis suite for cavefish bioinformatics"}, {"id": "286_1945", "label": "not relevant", "start_offset": 79, "end_offset": 92, "entity": "Saccharomyces", "which_text": "title", "text": "Osmolyte homeostasis controls single-cell growth rate and maximum cell size of Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}, {"id": "287_992", "label": "plasmid", "start_offset": 184, "end_offset": 190, "entity": "pFB291", "which_text": "sent_with_neighbors", "text": "All the measurements were performed in E. coli Mach1-T1 with three biological replicates. \u201cNC\u201d represents E. coli Mach1-T1 without plasmids.

DNA recombination employing the Cre-lox system is commonly used as a molecular switch for inducing the expression of recombinant proteins encoded within a bicistronic cassette. In such an approach, the two protein-coding sequences are separated by a 2A peptide or internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and expression is designed to be strictly Cre-dependent by using a lox-STOP-lox cassette or flip-excision (FLEX) switch. However, low-level or \u2018leaky\u2019 expression of recombinant proteins is often observed in the absence of Cre activity, potentially compromising the utility of this approach. To investigate the mechanism of leaky gene expression, we generated pCAG-lox-GFP-STOP-lox-Transgene A-2A-Transgene B vectors, which are designed to express nuclear-targeted GFP in the absence of Cre, and express both transgenes A and B after Cre-mediated recombination. We found that cells transfected with these bicistronic vectors exhibited low-level Cre-independent expression specifically of the transgene positioned 3\u2032 of the 2A peptide. We observed similar results in vivo by viral transduction of the adult mouse cerebral cortex with AAV-mutagenesis of putative transcription factor binding sites that the 5\u2032 transgene confers promoter-like activity that drives expression of the 3\u2032 transgene. Finally, we demonstrate that inclusion of an additional lox-STOP-lox cassette between the 2A sequence and 3\u2032 transgene dramatically reduces the extent of Cre-independent leaky gene expression. Our findings highlight that caution should be applied to the use of Cre-dependent bicistronic constructs when tight regulation of transgene expression is desired and provide a guide to preventing leaky gene expression when the expression of more than one protein is required."}, {"id": "307_845", "label": "counter selection", "start_offset": 203, "end_offset": 207, "entity": "galK", "which_text": "sent_with_neighbors", "text": "2011).

Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a biological material with impressive physical properties and low cost of production that is an attractive substrate for ELMs. Inspired by how plants build materials from tissues with specialist cells we here developed a system for making novel BC-based ELMs by addition of engineered yeast programmed to add functional traits to a cellulose matrix.

Our Syn-SCOBY approach allows inoculation of engineered cells into simple growth media, and under mild conditions materials self-assemble with genetically-programmable functional properties in days. We show that co-cultured yeast can be engineered to secrete enzymes into BC, generating autonomously grown catalytic materials and enabling DNA-encoded modification of BC bulk material properties. We further developed a method for incorporating S. cerevisiae within the growing cellulose matrix, creating living materials that can sense chemical and optical inputs.

We used inducible Cre recombination to target expression of Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2(H134R)-EYFP) in skeletal muscle (Acta1-Cre) in mice. Fluorescent imaging confirmed that ChR2 expression is localized in skeletal muscle and does not have specific expression in sciatic nerve branch, therefore, allowing for non-nerve mediated optical stimulation of skeletal muscle. We induced muscle contraction using transdermal exposure to blue light and selected 10Hz stimulation after controlled optimization experiments to sustain prolonged muscle contraction. Increasing the stimulation frequency from 10Hz to 40Hz increased the muscle contraction decay during prolonged 1s stimulation, highlighting frequency dependency and importance of membrane repolarization for effective light activation.

Through synthetic biology, it is possible to improve existing organisms to process waste that is traditionally not used for biofuel production, such as whey. With the redesign of metabolic pathways, it is possible to create connections for the implementation of new organisms that carry out functions that are normally not present in nature. From a computational point of view, metabolic pathways, which can be found in data sources as KEGG, can be converted to a graph data structure. These transformations enable the use of well-known algorithms, which enables the optimization of the analyses required to achieve the assembly of new organisms. The present work aims to design a tool for the transformation of metabolic pathways and the development of path finding algorithms that establish relevant links between compounds that are essential to the biofuel production process. As a result, a catalog of biobricks is created from the analysis of a subset of paths which can be used in the design stage of the synthetic assembly of the E. coli bacteria. The assembly\u2019s structure and functions are characterized according to the pieces used. Finally, new constructions are visualized with the goal of demonstrating and supporting the analysis processes, thus assisting people that work in the field of Synthetic Biology.

In eukaryotic cells, two main repair pathways have evolved to repair DSBs, homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). HR is the predominant pathway of repair in the unicellular eukaryotic organism, S. cerevisiae. However, during replicative aging the relative use of HR and NHEJ shifts in favor of end-joining repair. By monitoring repair events in the HO-DSB system, we find that early in replicative aging there is a decrease in the association of long-range resection factors, Dna2-Sgs1 and Exo1 at the break site and a decrease in DNA resection. Subsequently, as aging progressed, the recovery of Ku70 at DSBs decreased and the break site associated with the nuclear pore complex at the nuclear periphery, which is the location where DSB repair occurs through alternative pathways that are more mutagenic. End-bridging remained intact as HR and NHEJ declined, but eventually it too became disrupted in cells at advanced replicative age. In all, our work provides insight into the molecular changes in DSB repair pathway during replicative aging. HR first declined, resulting in a transient increase in the NHEJ. However, with increased cellular divisions, Ku70 recovery at DSBs and NHEJ subsequently declined. In wild type cells of advanced replicative age, there was a high frequency of repair products with genomic deletions and microhomologies at the break junction, events not observed in young cells which repaired primarily by HR. Highlights Decreased DNA resection at DSBs is an early event of replicative aging End-joining repair increases as resection decreases at DSBs in older cells In older cells the products of DSB repair contain deletions and microhomologies DSBs associate with the NPC at the nuclear periphery more in older cells Old Cell Enrichment method suitable for molecular biology approaches in budding yeast\n"}, {"id": "321_1978", "label": "reporter", "start_offset": 219, "end_offset": 223, "entity": "EGFP", "which_text": "sent_with_neighbors", "text": "All strains are derivatives of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14.

Carbon dioxide would be an ideal carbon source for these production systems, but efficient production of long carbon chains from CO2 is difficult to achieve in a single organism. A potential solution is to employ acetogenic bacteria for the reduction of CO2 to acetate, and engineer a second organism to convert the acetate into long-chain hydrocarbons. Results In this study, we demonstrate alkane production from CO2 by a system combining the acetogen Acetobacterium woodii and a non-native alkane producer Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 engineered for alkane production. Nine synthetic two-step alkane biosynthesis pathways consisting of different aldehyde- and alkane-producing enzymes were combinatorically constructed and expressed in A. baylyi. The aldehyde-producing enzymes studied were AAR from Synechococcus elongatus, Acr1 from A. baylyi, and Ramo, a putative dehydrogenase, from Nevskia ramosa. The alkane-producing enzymes were ADOs from S. elongatus and Nostoc punctiforme, and CER1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. The performance of the pathways was evaluated with a twin-layer biosensor, which allowed the monitoring of both the intermediate, fatty aldehyde, as well as the alkane production. The highest alkane production, as indicated by the biosensor, was achieved with a pathway consisting of AAR and ADO from S. elongatus. The performance of this pathway was further improved by balancing the relative expression levels of the enzymes in order to limit the accumulation of the intermediate fatty aldehyde. Finally, the acetogen A. woodii was used to produce acetate from CO2 and H2, and the acetate was used for alkane production by the engineered A. baylyi, thereby leading to the net production of long-chain alkanes from CO2. Conclusions A modular system for the production of drop-in liquid fuels from CO2 was demonstrated. Among the studied synthetic pathways, the combination of ADO and AAR from S. elongatus was found to be the most efficient in heterologous alkane production in A. baylyi. Furthermore, limiting the accumulation of the fatty aldehyde intermediate was found to be beneficial for the alkane production."}, {"id": "338_1999", "label": "not relevant", "start_offset": 132, "end_offset": 141, "entity": "materials", "which_text": "title", "text": "Getting there and staying there: supporting and enabling persistent human life on Mars using synthetic natural rubber, self-healing materials, and biological batteries"}, {"id": "339_2000", "label": "genome engineering", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 65, "entity": "Cre recombinase", "which_text": "title", "text": "Unloxing the assembly and activation mechanism of Cre recombinase using Cryo-EM"}, {"id": "339_2001", "label": "genome engineering", "start_offset": 100, "end_offset": 108, "entity": "Cre-loxP", "which_text": "sent_with_neighbors", "text": "This work provides new insights into the mechanism of site recognition by Cre.

Many ncRNA genes are narrowly distributed to only a few organisms, and appear to be rapidly evolving. Compared to protein coding sequences, there are many challenges associated with assessment of ncRNAs that are not well addressed by conventional phylogenetic approaches, including: short sequence length, lack of primary sequence conservation, and the importance of secondary structure for biological function. Riboswitches are structured ncRNAs that directly interact with small molecules to regulate gene expression in bacteria. They typically consist of a ligand-binding domain (aptamer) whose folding changes drive changes in gene expression. The glycine riboswitch is among the most well-studied due to the widespread occurrence of a tandem aptamer arrangement (tandem), wherein two homologous aptamers interact with glycine and each other to regulate gene expression. However, a significant proportion of glycine riboswitches are comprised of single aptamers (singleton). Here we use graph clustering to circumvent the limitations of traditional phylogenetic analysis when studying the relationship between the tandem and singleton glycine aptamers. Graph clustering enables a broader range of pairwise comparison measures to be used to assess aptamer similarity. Using this approach, we show that one aptamer of the tandem glycine riboswitch pair is typically much more highly conserved, and that which aptamer is conserved depends on the regulated gene. Furthermore, our analysis also reveals that singleton aptamers are more similar to either the first or second tandem aptamer, again based on the regulated gene. Taken together, our findings suggest that tandem glycine riboswitches degrade into functional singletons, with the regulated gene(s) dictating which glycine-binding aptamer is conserved. Author Summary The glycine riboswitch is a ncRNA responsible for the regulation of several distinct gene sets in bacteria that is found with either one (singleton) or two (tandem) aptamers, each of which directly senses glycine. Which aptamer is more important for gene-regulation, and the functional difference between tandem and singleton aptamers, are long-standing questions in the riboswitch field. Like many biologically functional RNAs, glycine aptamers require a specific 3D folded conformation. Thus, they have low primary sequence similarity across distantly related homologs, and large changes in sequence length that make creation and analysis of accurate multiple sequence alignments challenging. To better understand the relationship between tandem and singleton aptamers, we used a graph clustering approach that allows us to compare the similarity of aptamers using metrics that measure both sequence and structure similarity. Our investigation reveals that in tandem glycine riboswitches, one aptamer is more highly conserved than the other, and which aptamer is conserved depends on what gene(s) are regulated. Moreover, we find that many singleton glycine riboswitches likely originate from tandem riboswitches in which the ligand-binding site of the non-conserved aptamer has degraded over time."}, {"id": "345_897", "label": "cloning method", "start_offset": 696, "end_offset": 707, "entity": "GoldenBraid", "which_text": "sent_with_neighbors", "text": "One of the many goals of synthetic biology is the standardization of gene sequences encoding characterized biochemical parts to ease distribution and standardize assemblies1\u20132.

Here, we describe a new approach to rapidly analyze and visualize large numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Using Python, genomes are filtered for problematic sites, incomplete coverage, and excessive divergence from a strict molecular clock. All differences from the reference genome, including indels, are extracted using minimap2, and compactly stored as a set of features for each genome. For each Pango lineage (https://cov-lineages.org), we collapse genomes with identical features into \u2018variants\u2019, generate 100 bootstrap samples of the feature set union to generate weights, and compute the symmetric differences between the weighted feature sets for every pair of variants. The resulting distance matrices are used to generate neigihbor-joining trees in RapidNJ and converted into a majority-rule consensus tree for the lineage. Branches with support values below 50% or mean lengths below 0.5 differences are collapsed, and tip labels on affected branches are mapped to internal nodes as directly-sampled ancestral variants. Currently, we process about million genomes in approximately nine hours on 34 cores. The resulting trees are visualized using the JavaScript framework D3.js as \u2018beadplots\u2019, in which variants are represented by horizontal line segments, annotated with beads representing samples by collection date.

Its stochastic fluctuations due to intrinsic and extrinsic sources, known generically as \u2018gene expression noise\u2019, trigger both beneficial and harmful consequences for the cell behavior. Controlling gene expression noise is of interest in many applications in biotechnology, biomedicine and others. Yet, control of the mean expression level is an equally desirable goal. Here, we analyze a gene synthetic network designed to reduce gene expression noise while achieving a desired mean expression level. The circuit combines a negative feedback loop over the gene of interest, and a cell-to-cell communication mechanism based on quorum sensing. We analyze the ability of the circuit to reduce noise as a function of parameters that can be tuned in the wet-lab, and the role quorum sensing plays. Intrinsic noise is generated by the inherent stochasticity of biochemical reactions. On the other hand, extrinsic noise is due to variability in the cell environment and the amounts of cellular components that affect gene expression. We develop a realistic model of the gene synthetic circuit over the population of cells using mass action kinetics and the stochastic Chemical Langevin Equation to include intrinsic noise, with parameters drawn from a distribution to account for extrinsic noise. Stochastic simulations allow us to quantify the mean expression level and noise strength of all species under different scenarios, showing good agreement with system-wide available experimental data of protein abundance and noise in E. coli. Our in silico experiments reveal significant noise attenuation in gene expression through the interplay between quorum sensing and the negative feedback, allowing control of the mean expression and variance of the protein of interest. These in silico conclusions are validated by preliminary experimental results. This gene network could have important implications as a robust protein production system in industrial biotechnology. Author Summary Controlling gene expression level is of interest in many applications in biotechnology, biomedicine and others. Yet, the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions plays an important role in biological systems, and cannot be disregarded. Gene expression noise resulting from this stochasticity has been studied over the past years both in vivo, and in silico using mathematical models. Nowadays, synthetic biology approaches allow to design novel biological circuits, drawing on principles elucidated from biology and engineering, for the purpose of decoupled control of mean gene expression and its variance. We propose a gene synthetic circuit with these characteristics, using negative feedback and quorum sensing based cell-to-cell communication to induce population consensus. Our in silico analysis using stochastic simulations with a realistic model reveal significant noise attenuation in gene expression through the interplay between quorum sensing and the negative feedback, allowing control of the mean expression and variance of the protein of interest. Preliminary in vivo results fully agree with the computational ones."}, {"id": "367_916", "label": "plasmid", "start_offset": 639, "end_offset": 645, "entity": "pSB1C3", "which_text": "sent_with_neighbors", "text": "A \u201cTATATA\u201d sequence was added at the beginning of the forward primer and at the end of the reverse primer for DNA polymerase binding.

In this study, we describe the model-guided design and experimental characterization of several engineered P(3HB) producing operons. In particular, we describe the characterization of a novel hybrid phaCAB operon that consists of a dual promoter (native and J23104) and RBS (native and B0034) design. P(3HB) production was around six-fold higher in hybrid phaCAB engineered Escherichia coli in comparison to E. coli engineered with the native phaCAB operon from Ralstonia eutropha H16.

SHDB ablation reprograms energy metabolism and hyperactivates the glycolysis, Krebs cycle and \u03b2-oxidation pathways, leading to catastrophic energy deficit and early death. Strikingly, sucrose supplementation or high fat diet resumes both glucose and lipid metabolism and prevent early death.

They are essential components in the DNA damage response (DDR) and more specifically, protecting cells from DNA double strand breaks. Similarly, the Gram-positive Bacterium Bacillus subtilis Class-II fumarase, in addition to its role in the TCA cycle, also participates in the DDR. Escherichia coli, harbors three fumarase genes; Class-I fumA and fumB and Class-II fumC. Notably, Class-I fumarases, show no sequence similarity to Class-II fumarases and are of different evolutionary origin. Strikingly, here we show that E. coli fumarase functions are distributed between Class-I fumarases which participate in the DDR, and the Class-II fumarase which participates in respiration. In E. coli, we discover that the signaling molecule, alpha-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG), has a novel function, complementing DNA damage sensitivity of fum null mutants. Excitingly, we identify the E. coli \u03b1-KG dependent DNA repair enzyme AlkB, as the target of this interplay of metabolite signaling. In addition to \u03b1-KG, fumarate (fumaric acid) is shown to affect DNA damage repair on two different levels, first by directly inhibiting the DNA damage repair enzyme AlkB demethylase activity, both in vitro and in vivo (countering \u03b1-KG). The second is a more global effect on transcription, as fum null mutants exhibit a decrease in transcription of key DNA damage repair genes. Together these results show evolutionary adaptable metabolic signaling of the DDR, in which fumarases and different metabolites are recruited regardless of the evolutionary enzyme Class preforming the function. Significance Statement Class-II fumarases have been shown to participate in cellular respiration and the DNA damage response. Here we show, for the first time, that in the model prokaryote, Escherichia coli, which harbors both Class-I and Class-II fumarases, it is the Class-I fumarases that participate in DNA damage repair by a mechanism which is different than those described for other fumarases. Strikingly, this mechanism employs a novel signaling molecule, alpha-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG), and its target is the DNA damage repair enzyme AlkB. In addition, we show that fumarase precursor metabolites, fumarate and succinate, can inhibit the \u03b1-KG-dependent DNA damage repair enzyme, AlkB, both in vitro and in vivo.

These structural and biochemical studies have suggested that conformational changes and DNA bending in presynaptic complexes underlie site-selection and activation mechanisms of Cre recombinase. Here we used protein engineering and various DNA substrates to isolate the Cre-loxP (54 kDa), Cre2-loxP (110 kDa), and Cre4-loxP2 assembly intermediates, and determined their structures using cryo-EM to resolutions of 3.9 \u00c5, 4.5 \u00c5, and 3.2 \u00c5, respectively. Progressive DNA bending along the assembly pathway enables formation of increasingly intimate protein-protein interfaces. Insufficient stabilization of important protein motifs observed during the assembly process provides a compelling explanation for the observed half-the-sites activity, and preferential bottom strand cleavage of loxP sequences. We found that selection of loxP sites is largely dependent on Cre\u2019s ability to bend and stabilize the spacer region between two recombinase binding elements. Application of 3D variability analysis to the tetramer data reveals a propensity for motion along the pathway between protomer activation and Holliday junction isomerization. These findings help us to better understand loxP site specificity, controlled activation of alternating protomers, the basis for the observed bias of strand cleavage order, and the importance of conformational sampling, especially with regards to site-selection and activity among Cre variants. Furthermore, our findings provide invaluable information for the rational development of designer, site-specific recombinases for use as gene editing technologies. Highlights Cryo-EM structures of Cre-loxP assembly intermediates (monomer, dimer, and tetramer) provide insights into mechanisms of site recognition, half-the-sites activity, strand cleavage order, and concerted strand cleavage Selectivity of loxP sites arises from few base-specific contacts made by each protomer and is mainly driven by formation of phosphate contacts and DNA deformations that are maximal in the fully assembled \u201cactive\u201d tetramer Cis and trans interactions of the \u03b22-3 loop (i) define which sites are \u201cactive\u201d and (ii) ensure half-the-sites activity Protein flexibility plays a central role in enabling DNA sequence scanning, recruitment of a second protein to form a dimer, synapsis, control of activity, as well as subsequent recombination steps Conformational sampling within the tetrameric complex was uncovered using 3D variability analysis and revealed the importance of protein-protein interfaces for site- selection and activation of Cre-loxP complexes\n"}, {"id": "425_2093", "label": "not relevant", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 61, "entity": "Saccharomyces", "which_text": "title", "text": "Rapid conversion of replicating and integrating Saccharomyces cerevisiae plasmid vectors via Cre recombinase"}, {"id": "426_2094", "label": "not relevant", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10, "entity": "Myocardial", "which_text": "abstract", "text": "Myocardial infarction is a leading cause of death worldwide, as the adult human heart does not have the ability to regenerate efficiently after insults.

While several pro-regenerative factors have been described, the cell types orchestrating heart regeneration remain largely elusive. To overcome this conceptual limitation, we dissected cell type diversity in the regenerating zebrafish heart based on single cell transcriptomics and spatiotemporal analysis. We discovered a dramatic induction of several pro-regenerative cell types with fibroblast characteristics. To understand the cascade of events leading to heart regeneration, we determined the origin of these cell types by high-throughput lineage tracing. We found that pro-regenerative fibroblasts are derived from two separate sources, the epicardium and the endocardium. Mechanistically, we identified Wnt signaling as a key regulator of the endocardial regenerative response.

By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems.

We have tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

Cre-Y1 was introduced into the Upleu locus of Po1f, and then recombination between two lox71 sites could remove unnecessary plasmid elements and produce an initial strain harboring a lox71 site. Subsequently, Cre-Y2 was integrated onto the leu2 locus, forming a transitional strain with three lox sites (lox71, lox66, and rclox66). Recombination reactions among these three lox sites could excise unnecessary DNA fragments and retain a lox72 site, an rclox66 site, and a target gene expression cassette in the genome. Similarly, integration of Cre-Y3 produced strains harboring two target gene expression cassettes. Consequently, repeated, targeted, and markerless gene integration could be efficiently realized following iterative integration of Cre-Y2 and Cre-Y3.

Nonetheless, utilization of this promising host is still restricted by limited availability of precise and effective gene integration tools. In this study, a novel and efficient genetic tool was developed for targeted, repeated, and markerless gene integration based on Cre/lox site-specific recombination system. The developed tool required only a single selection marker and could completely excise all of the unnecessary sequences. A total of three plasmids were created and seven rounds of marker-free gene integration were examined in Y. lipolytica. All the integration efficiencies remained above 90%, and analysis of protein production and growth characteristics of the engineered strains confirmed that genome modification via the novel genetic tool was feasible.

We developed here a highly effective new method using only deltaCas9(dCas9):gRNA site-specific targeting to physically block DNA methylation at specific targets in the absence of a confounding flexibly-tethered enzymatic activity, enabling examination of the role of DNA methylation per se in living cells. We show that the extensive induction of gene expression achieved by TET/dCas9-based targeting vectors is confounded by DNA methylation-independent activities, inflating the role of DNA methylation in the promoter region. Using our new method, we show that in several inducible promoters, the main effect of DNA methylation is silencing basal promoter activity. Thus, the effect of demethylation of the promoter region in these genes is small, while induction of gene expression by different inducers is large and DNA methylation independent. In contrast, targeting demethylation to the pathologically silenced FMR1 gene targets robust induction of gene expression. We also found that standard CRISPR/Cas9 knockout generates a broad unmethylated region around the deletion, which might confound interpretation of CRISPR/Cas9 gene depletion studies.

In this report we describe a method relying on the high recombination rates of E. faecium and the application of the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 genome editing tool to more efficiently generate targeted mutants in the E. faecium chromosome. Using this tool and the multi-drug resistant clinical E. faecium strain E745, we generated a deletion mutant in the lacL gene, which encodes the large subunit of the E. faecium \u03b2-galactosidase. Blue/white screening using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) could be used to distinguish between the wild-type and lacL deletion mutant. We also inserted two copies of gfp into the intrinsic E. faecium macrolide resistance gene msrC to generate stable green fluorescent cells. We conclude that CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to generate targeted genome modifications in E. faecium in 3 weeks, with limited hands-on time.

Here, we resolve this long-standing conundrum by comparatively analyzing the interactions and output activities of DrBphP and a bacteriophytochrome from Agrobacterium fabrum (AgP1).

While AgP1 binds its cognate response regulator only transiently, DrBphP does so strongly, which is rationalized at the structural level.

We first characterized OleTMC and demonstrated its in vitro H2O2-independent activities towards linear and saturated C10:0-C18:0 FAs, with the highest activity for C16:0 and C18:0 FAs. Combining protein homology modeling, in silico residue mutation analysis, and docking simulation with direct experimental evidence, we elucidated the underlying mechanism for governing the observed substrate preference of OleTMC, which depends on the size of FA binding pocket, not the catalytic site. Next, we engineered the terminal alkene biosynthesis pathway, consisting of an engineered E. coli thioesterase (TesA*) and OleTMC, and introduced this pathway into E. coli for direct terminal alkene biosynthesis from glucose. The recombinant strain E. coli EcNN101 produced a total of 17.78 \u00b1 0.63 mg/L odd-chain terminal alkenes, comprising of 0.9% \u00b1 0.5% C11 alkene, 12.7% \u00b1 2.2% C13 alkene, 82.7% \u00b1 1.7% C15 alkene, and 3.7% \u00b1 0.8% C17 alkene, and a yield of 0.87 \u00b1 0.03 (mg/g) on glucose after 48 h in baffled shake flasks. To improve the terminal alkene production, we identified and overcame the electron transfer limitation in OleTMC, by introducing a two-component redox system, consisting of a putidaredoxin reductase CamA and a putidaredoxin CamB from Pseudomonas putida, into EcNN101, and demonstrated the terminal alkene production increased \u223c2.8 fold after 48 h.

Senataxin (SETX) is a putative helicase, mutated in two neurodegenerative disorders, which has been implicated in the control of R-loop accumulation and in transcription termination. However, understanding the precise role of SETX in these processes has been precluded by the absence of a direct characterisation of SETX biochemical activities. Here, we purify and characterise the helicase domain of SETX in parallel with its yeast orthologue, Sen1. Importantly, we show that SETX is a bona fide helicase with the ability to resolve R-loops.

We aimed to use Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) gene editing technique to induce forced down-regulation of the circRNA which consequently modified miRNA expression in HepG2 cell line to prove the regulatory relationship between the RNA parts of an in silico-detected competing endogenous RNA network in HCC Method We first retrieved hsa_circ_0000064-miR-1285-TRIM2 mRNA from public microarray databases followed by in silico modelling to mimic the regulation kinetics of cirRNA associated ceRNA network. Secondly, we performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based amplification of synthetic fragments, Gibson assembly of both CRISPR and non CRISPR based circuits, E-coli transformation, plasmid purification, HePG2 cell line transfection. Finally Expression levels of the chosen RNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line, HepG2, were examined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and the cytotoxic effect was validated by viability assay.TRIM2 protein expression was proved by immunohistochemistry and flowcytometry. Results Induction of hsa_circ_0000064 into HepG2 cell line via CRISPR-and non-CRISPR mediated synthetic circuit resulted in statistically significant decrease in cell number and, then, cellular viability with marked increase in hsa_circ_0000064 and TRIM2 mRNA levels and concomitant decrease in miR-1285 expression in HepG2 cell line compared with control (p<0.0). Moreover exogenous expression of hsa_circ_0000064 in HepG2 cell line showed increased expression of the tumor suppressor protein, TRIM2. Conclusions Our integrative approach, including in silico data analysis and experimental validation proved that CRISPR-mediated synthetic circuit-based overexpression of hsa_circ_0000064 was more efficient than conventional transient transfection, representing a promising therapeutic strategy for HCC.

However, the potential of SCRaMbLE to study genomic rearrangements is currently hindered, because a strain containing all 16 synthetic chromosomes is not yet available. Here, we constructed a yeast strain, SparLox83, containing 83 loxPsym sites distributed across all 16 chromosomes, with at least two sites per chromosome. Inducing Cre recombinase expression in SparLox83 produced versatile genome-wide genomic rearrangements, including inter-chromosomal events. Moreover, SCRaMbLE of the hetero-diploid strains derived from crossing SparLox83 with strains possessing synthetic chromosome III (synIII) from the Sc2.0 project led to increased diversity of genomic rearrangements and relatively faster evolution of traits compared to a strain with only synIII. Analysis of these evolved strains demonstrates that genomic rearrangements can perturb the transcriptome and 3D genome structure and can consequently impact phenotypes.

Principal findings A suicide vector was constructed using the pUC57 plasmid backbone. In the vector, the kanR gene was cloned downstream of the tp0574 gene promoter. The tp0574prom-kanR cassette was then placed between two 1-kbp homology arms identical to the sequences upstream and downstream of the tprA pseudogene. To induce homologous recombination and integration of the kanR cassette into the T. pallidum chromosome, in vitro-cultured SS14 strain spirochetes were exposed to the engineered vector in a CaCl2-based transformation buffer and let recover for 24 hours before adding kanamycin-containing selective media. Integration of the kanR cassette was demonstrated by qualitative PCR, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of transformed treponemes propagated in vitro and in vivo. ddPCR analysis of RNA and mass spectrometry confirmed expression of the kanR message and protein in treponemes propagated in vitro. Moreover, tprA knockout (tprAko-SS14) treponemes grew in kanamycin concentrations that were 64 times higher than the MIC for the wild-type SS14 (wt-SS14) strain and in infected rabbits treated with kanamycin. Conclusion We demonstrated that genetic manipulation of T. pallidum is attainable.

Author Summary Syphilis is still an endemic disease in many low- and middle-income countries, and it has been resurgent in high-income nations for almost two decades.

We previously engineered a model cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, to secrete the bulk of the carbon it fixes as sucrose, a carbohydrate that can be utilized by many other microbes. Here, we tested the capability of sucrose-secreting cyanobacteria to act as a flexible platform for the construction of synthetic, light-driven consortia by pairing them with three disparate heterotrophs: Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The comparison of these different co-culture dyads reveals general design principles for the construction of robust autotroph/heterotroph consortia. Main findings We observed heterotrophic growth dependent upon cyanobacterial photosynthate in each co-culture pair. Furthermore, these synthetic consortia could be stabilized over the long-term (weeks to months) and both species could persist when challenged with specific perturbations. Stability and productivity of autotroph/heterotroph co-cultures was dependent on heterotroph sucrose utilization, as well as other species-independent interactions that we observed across all dyads. One interaction we observed to destabilize consortia was that non-sucrose byproducts of photosynthesis negatively impacted heterotroph growth. Conversely, inoculation of each heterotrophic species enhanced cyanobacterial growth in comparison to axenic cultures Finally, these consortia can be flexibly programmed for photoproduction of target compounds and proteins; by changing the heterotroph in co\u2013culture to specialized strains of B. subtilis or E. coli we demonstrate production of alpha-amylase and polyhydroxybutyrate, respectively. Conclusions Enabled by the unprecedented flexibility of this consortia design, we uncover species-independent design principles that influence cyanobacteria/heterotroph consortia robustness. The modular nature of these communities and their unusual robustness exhibits promise as a platform for highly-versatile photoproduction strategies that capitalize on multi-species interactions and could be utilized as a tool for the study of nascent symbioses. Further consortia improvements via engineered interventions beyond those we show here (i.e. increased efficiency growing on sucrose) could improve these communities as production platforms."}, {"id": "502_1353", "label": "genome engineering", "start_offset": 244, "end_offset": 252, "entity": "Cre-LoxP", "which_text": "sent_with_neighbors", "text": "To understand the overall contribution of the membrane-bound export apparatus proteins to the structure and assembly of the flagellar motor, we generated a quintuple \u0394fliP-flhA mutant by deleting fliP, fliQ, fliR, flhB and flhA genes using the Cre-LoxP method (Bestor et al., 2010).

Here, we report an elegant approach, The Dpn Adaptor Linked Effector (DAL-E) system, to target fusion proteins to 6-methyladenosine in GATC, which appears frequently in popular eukaryotic expression vectors and is absent from endogenous genomic DNA. Methods: The DNA-binding region from the DpnI endonuclease binds 6-methyladenosine within the GATC motif. We used a Dpn-transcriptional activator (DPN7-TA) fusion to induce gene expression from transiently transfected pDNAs. Results We validated methylation-dependent activity of DPN7-TA with a panel of target pDNAs. We observed stronger transactivation when GATC targets were located upstream of the transcriptional start site in the target pDNA. Conclusion: DAL-E, consisting of a 108 aa, 12 kD DNA-binding adaptor and a 4 bp recognition site, offers a genetically-tractable, tunable system that can potentially be redesigned to recruit a variety of regulators (e.g. activators, silencers, epigenome editors) to transfected plasmid DNA. LAY SUMMARY Transfection of plasmid DNA (pDNA) is a commonly used method for introducing exogenous genetic material into mammalian cells. Once introduced into cells not all pDNAs express this genetic material at sufficient levels. Current techniques to improve transgene expression are limited and are not always feasible for all plasmids. This report presents a new method to improve gene expression from pDNA. The Dpn Adaptor Linked Effector (DAL-E) binds to methylated adenines in the pDNA resulting in increased expression. This technique has exciting implications for improved genetic engineering of mammalian cells."}, {"id": "505_1359", "label": "cloning method", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 25, "entity": "Gibson", "which_text": "sent_with_neighbors", "text": "We have chosen the Gibson assembly as a method of constructing the plasmids rather than other approaches such as the BioBrick assembly26 because of its reliability and simplicity.27 As our designs are straightforward one-step assemblies that could be extended to virtually any new parts, Gibson assembly only requires PCR primers or direct synthesis of the new parts, which are relatively easy to design, it has support of software packages such as SnapGene (https://www.snapgene.com) or Benchling (https://www.benchling.com) and do not require avoiding restriction enzyme target sequences within the parts.

Specifically, we have taken two genetic circuits-one for signaling from the quorum sensing system and the other for memory from the bacteriophage genetic switch\u2013and integrated them into a robust system that can report on successful communication in the mammalian gut.

Here, we report the development and validation of a bioluminescence-based intracellular calcium release assay for TAS2Rs that has a better assay performance than a fluorescence-based assay.

Additionally, improvement to the bioluminescence-based assay for some TAS2Rs was achieved by altering their N-terminal signal sequences, leading to signal window enhancement.

During cell division of Ustilago maydis, for example, chitinases must be specifically targeted to the fragmentation zone at the site of cell division to degrade remnant chitin and thus separate mother and daughter cells. Chitinase Cts1 is exported to this location via an unconventional secretion pathway putatively operating in a lock-type manner. The underlying mechanism is largely unexplored. Here, we applied a forward genetic screen based on UV mutagenesis to identify components essential for Cts1 export. The screen revealed a novel factor termed Jps1 lacking known protein domains. Deletion of the corresponding gene confirmed its essential role for Cts1 secretion. Localization studies demonstrated that Jps1 colocalizes with Cts1 in the fragmentation zone of dividing yeast cells. While loss of Jps1 leads to exclusion of Cts1 from the fragmentation zone and strongly reduced unconventional secretion, deletion of the chitinase does not disturb Jps1 localization. Yeast-two hybrid experiments suggest that the two proteins interact. In essence, we identified a novel component of unconventional secretion that functions in the fragmentation zone to enable export of Cts1. We hypothesize that Jps1 acts as an anchoring factor, supporting the proposed novel lock-type mechanism of unconventional secretion."}, {"id": "520_1412", "label": "not relevant", "start_offset": 454, "end_offset": 465, "entity": "human cell ", "which_text": "sent_with_neighbors", "text": "Irreversibility: LSRs have non-identical recognition sites typically known as attB (attachment site bacteria) and attP (attachment site phage) and yield hybrid product sites attL and attR.

To address this, we systematically altered transcription and translation of single genes encoding parts of the primary EET pathway of S. oneidensis, CymA/MtrCAB, and examined how expression differences affected model-fitted parameters for Fe(III) reduction kinetics. Using a suite of plasmid-based inducible circuits maintained by appropriate S. oneidensis knockout strains, we pinpointed construct/strain pairings that expressed cymA, mtrA, and mtrC with maximal dynamic range of Fe(III) reduction rate. These optimized EET gene constructs were employed to create Buffer and NOT gate architectures, that predictably turn on and turn off EET flux, respectively, in response to IPTG. Furthermore, we found that response functions generated by these logic gates (i.e., EET activity vs. inducer concentration) were comparable to those generated by conventional synthetic biology circuits, where fluorescent reporters are the output.

To grow, bacteria must continuously remodel their wall, inserting new material and breaking old bonds. Bond cleavage is performed by cell wall hydrolases, allowing the wall to expand. Understanding the functions of individual hydrolases has been impeded by their redundancy: single knockouts usually present no phenotype. We used an exhaustive multiple-knockout approach to determine the minimal set of hydrolases required for growth in Bacillus subtilis. We identified 42 candidate cell wall hydrolases. Strikingly, we were able to remove all but two of these genes in a single strain; this \u201c\u039440\u201d strain shows a normal growth rate, indicating that none of the 40 hydrolases are necessary for cell growth. The \u039440 strain does not shed old cell wall, demonstrating that turnover is not essential for growth. The remaining two hydrolases in the \u039440 strain are LytE and CwlO, previously shown to be synthetically lethal. Either can be knocked out in \u039440, indicating that either hydrolase alone is sufficient for cell growth. Environmental screening and zymography revealed that LytE activity is inhibited by Mg2+ and that RlpA-like proteins may stimulate LytE activity. Together, these results demonstrate that the only essential function of cell wall hydrolases in B. subtilis is to enable cell growth by expanding the wall and that LytE or CwlO alone is sufficient for this function. These experiments introduce the \u039440 strain as a tool to study hydrolase activity and regulation in B. subtilis. IMPORTANCE In order to grow, bacterial cells must both create and break down their cell wall. The enzymes that are responsible for these processes are the target of some of our best antibiotics. Our understanding of the proteins that break down the wall \u2013 cell wall hydrolases \u2013 has been limited by redundancy among the large number of hydrolases many bacteria contain. To solve this problem, we identified 42 cell wall hydrolases in Bacillus subtilis and created a strain lacking 40 of them. We show that cells can survive using only a single cell wall hydrolase; this means that to understand the growth of B. subtilis in standard laboratory conditions, it is only necessary to study a very limited number of proteins, simplifying the problem substantially. We additionally show that the \u039440 strain is a research tool to characterize hydrolases, using it to identify 3 \u2018helper\u2019 hydrolases that act in certain stress conditions."}, {"id": "535_1470", "label": "promoter", "start_offset": 513, "end_offset": 519, "entity": "J23100", "which_text": "sent_with_neighbors", "text": "As Cas1 is not required for the silencing function of the Cascade operon, gene silencing should not be affected. 3,29 This approach would require two modifications to future silencing strains, the deletion of cas3 and cas1 (Figure 1a).

Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is a major cause of foodborne illness worldwide, with pigs a major zoonotic reservoir. Two variants, S. Typhimurium phage type U288 and monophasic S. Typhimurium (S. 4,[5],12:i:-) ST34 emerged and have accounted for the majority of isolates from pigs in the UK in the past two decades, but have distinct host range and risk to food safety. ST34 accounts for over 50% of all S. Typhimurium infections in people while U288 less than 2%. U288 and ST34 form distinct phylogenetic clusters within S. Typhimurium, defined by approximately 600 SNPs within their 5 Mbp genomes. Evolution of the U288 clade from an LT2-like ancestor was characterised by the acquisition of AMR genes, insertions and deletions in the virulence plasmid pU288-1, and the accumulation of polymorphisms, some of which resulted in truncation of coding sequences. U288 isolates exhibited lower growth rate and viability following desiccation compared to ST34 isolates, characteristics that could affect transmission through the food chain. U288 and ST34 isolates exhibited distinct outcomes of infection in the murine model of colitis, and colonised pigs in a manner that affected the disease symptoms and distribution in organs. U288 infection was more disseminated in the lymph nodes while ST34 were recovered in greater numbers in the intestinal contents. These data are consistent with the evolution of S. Typhimurium U288 adaptation to pigs that may determine their reduced zoonotic potential. Importance Bacterial pathogens continually evolve to exploit new ecological niches as they emerge due to human activity including agricultural, medical or societal practice. The consequences of the emergence of new pathogens may affect outcome of infection and risk to human or animal health. Genome sequence can resolve the population structure, identify variants that are evolving as they enter a new niche, and pinpoint potential functional divergence. We report a variant S. Typhimurium that adapted to a unique niche distinct to that occupied by a second S. Typhimurium variant circulating in the same pig populations. Adaptation was accompanied by phenotypic and genotypic changes consistent with a more invasive lifestyle and a decreased zoonotic potential observed in the epidemiological record.

Carbon dioxide would be an ideal carbon source for these production systems, but efficient production of long carbon chains from CO2 is difficult to achieve in a single organism. A potential solution is to employ acetogenic bacteria for the reduction of CO2 to acetate, and engineer a second organism to convert the acetate into long-chain hydrocarbons. Results In this study, we demonstrate alkane production from CO2 by a system combining the acetogen Acetobacterium woodii and a non-native alkane producer Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 engineered for alkane production. Nine synthetic two-step alkane biosynthesis pathways consisting of different aldehyde- and alkane-producing enzymes were combinatorically constructed and expressed in A. baylyi. The aldehyde-producing enzymes studied were AAR from Synechococcus elongatus, Acr1 from A. baylyi, and Ramo, a putative dehydrogenase, from Nevskia ramosa. The alkane-producing enzymes were ADOs from S. elongatus and Nostoc punctiforme, and CER1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. The performance of the pathways was evaluated with a twin-layer biosensor, which allowed the monitoring of both the intermediate, fatty aldehyde, as well as the alkane production. The highest alkane production, as indicated by the biosensor, was achieved with a pathway consisting of AAR and ADO from S. elongatus. The performance of this pathway was further improved by balancing the relative expression levels of the enzymes in order to limit the accumulation of the intermediate fatty aldehyde. Finally, the acetogen A. woodii was used to produce acetate from CO2 and H2, and the acetate was used for alkane production by the engineered A. baylyi, thereby leading to the net production of long-chain alkanes from CO2. Conclusions A modular system for the production of drop-in liquid fuels from CO2 was demonstrated. Among the studied synthetic pathways, the combination of ADO and AAR from S. elongatus was found to be the most efficient in heterologous alkane production in A. baylyi. Furthermore, limiting the accumulation of the fatty aldehyde intermediate was found to be beneficial for the alkane production."}, {"id": "564_1583", "label": "genome engineering", "start_offset": 209, "end_offset": 216, "entity": "Cre-Lox", "which_text": "sent_with_neighbors", "text": "B. subtilis was barcoded using three different methods.

To this extent, we report potent LNP structures that robustly deliver mRNA to maternal organs and placenta. Using structure-function analysis, we show that LNP efficacy is influenced by the polyamine headgroup, and toxicity is governed by the acrylate tail. Our lead nanoparticle shows robust protein expression via multiple clinically relevant administration routes in pregnant mice. In the placenta, it transfects trophoblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells. Further, by varying ionizable lipid structure, we demonstrate that LNP immunogenicity affects organ expression and pup health during pregnancy. Immunogenic LNPs show lower efficacy in lymphoid organs in an IL-1\u03b2 dependent manner in pregnant mice. Further, pro-inflammatory immune responses provoke the infiltration of adaptive immune cells in the placenta and restrict pup growth after birth.

Here, we report an elegant approach, The Dpn Adaptor Linked Effector (DAL-E) system, to target fusion proteins to 6-methyladenosine in GATC, which appears frequently in popular eukaryotic expression vectors and is absent from endogenous genomic DNA. Methods: The DNA-binding region from the DpnI endonuclease binds 6-methyladenosine within the GATC motif. We used a Dpn-transcriptional activator (DPN7-TA) fusion to induce gene expression from transiently transfected pDNAs. Results We validated methylation-dependent activity of DPN7-TA with a panel of target pDNAs. We observed stronger transactivation when GATC targets were located upstream of the transcriptional start site in the target pDNA. Conclusion: DAL-E, consisting of a 108 aa, 12 kD DNA-binding adaptor and a 4 bp recognition site, offers a genetically-tractable, tunable system that can potentially be redesigned to recruit a variety of regulators (e.g. activators, silencers, epigenome editors) to transfected plasmid DNA. LAY SUMMARY Transfection of plasmid DNA (pDNA) is a commonly used method for introducing exogenous genetic material into mammalian cells. Once introduced into cells not all pDNAs express this genetic material at sufficient levels. Current techniques to improve transgene expression are limited and are not always feasible for all plasmids. This report presents a new method to improve gene expression from pDNA. The Dpn Adaptor Linked Effector (DAL-E) binds to methylated adenines in the pDNA resulting in increased expression.

Fluorescent protein knock-in results in bright signals compatible with low-light live microscopy from monoallelic modification, the potential to simultaneously image different alleles of the same gene and bypasses the need to work with clones. Protein levels are easily tunable to correspond with endogenous expression through cell sorting (DExCon), timing of light illumination (LUXon) or by exposing cells to different levels of auxin (DExogron). Furthermore, our approach allowed us to quantify previously unforeseen differences in vesicle dynamics, expression kinetics and protein stability among highly similar endogenous Rab11 family members and their colocalization in triple knock-in cells.

A total of 18 genes were identified by Tn-seq to contribute to survival in PBS, with functions associated with the general stress response, DNA repair, metabolism, and membrane homeostasis. The gene which was quantitatively most important for survival in PBS was usp (locus tag: EfmE745_02439), which is predicted to encode a 17.4 kDa universal stress protein. After generating a targeted deletion mutant in usp, we were able to confirm that usp significantly contributes to survival in PBS and this defect was restored by in trans complementation. As usp is present in 99% of 1644 E. faecium genomes that span the diversity of the species, we postulate that this gene is a key determinant for the remarkable environmental robustness of E. faecium.

Promoters can be roughly divided into two classes: constitutive promoters and inducible promoters. Promoters with clear functional annotations are practical synthetic biology biobricks. Many statistical and machine learning methods have been introduced to predict the functions of candidate promoters. Spectral Eigenmap has been proved to be an effective clustering method to classify biobricks, while support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful machine learning algorithm, especially when dataset is small. Methods The two algorithms: spectral embedding and SVM are applied to the same dataset with 375 prokaryotic promoters. For spectral embedding, a Laplacian matrix is built with edit distance, followed by K-Means Clustering. The sequences are represented by numeric vector to serve as dataset for SVM trainning. Results SVM achieved a high predicting accuracy of 93.07% in 10-fold cross validation for classification of promoters\u2019 transcriptional functions. Laplacian eigenmap (spectral embedding) based on editing distance may not be capable for extracting discriminative features for this task.

Orthogonally detectable red, green, and blue fluorescent proteins combined in a single vector system, dubbed RGB-S reporter, enable the simultaneous, independent and real-time analysis of the stress response in Escherichia coli to physiological stress, genotoxicity, and cytotoxicity. The sensor system can be read out via conventional fluorescence microscopy or microtiter plate analysis and can also be combined with Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and subsequent transcriptome analysis. Various stressors, such as the biotechnologically relevant 2-propanol, lead to the activation of one, two or all three SRs, which can have a significant impact on non-stress-related metabolic pathways.

Applied to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the workflow identifies four subtypes based on global gene expression patterns and ontologies. Three correspond to known subtypes, while the fourth is a previously undescribed neuroendocrine variant (NEv2). Tumor deconvolution with subtype gene signatures shows that all of the subtypes are detectable in varying proportions in human and mouse tumors. To understand how multiple stable subtypes can arise within a tumor, we infer a network of transcription factors and develop BooleaBayes, a minimally-constrained Boolean rule-fitting approach. In silico perturbations of the network identify master regulators and destabilizers of its attractors. Specific to NEv2, BooleaBayes predicts ELF3 and NR0B1 as master regulators of the subtype, and TCF3 as a master destabilizer. Since the four subtypes exhibit differential drug sensitivity, with NEv2 consistently least sensitive, these findings may lead to actionable therapeutic strategies that consider SCLC intratumoral heterogeneity. Our systems-level approach should generalize to other cancer types. Author summary Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an extremely aggressive disease with poor prognosis. Despite significant advances in treatments of other cancer types, therapeutic strategies for SCLC have remained unchanged for decades. We hypothesize that distinct SCLC subtypes with differential drug sensitivities may be responsible for poor treatment outcomes. To this end, we applied a computational pipeline to identify and characterize SCLC subtypes. We found four subtypes, including one (termed \u201cNEv2\u201d) that had not previously been reported. Across a broad panel of drugs, we show that NEv2 is more resistant than other SCLC subtypes, suggesting that this subtype may be partly responsible for poor treatment outcomes. Importantly, we validate the existence of NEv2 cells in both human and mouse tumors. Reprogramming the identity of NEv2 cells into other subtypes may sensitize these cells to existing treatments. However, deciphering global mechanisms that regulate different subtypes is generally unfeasible. To circumvent this, we developed BooleaBayes, a modeling approach that only infers local regulatory mechanisms near stable cell subtypes. Using BooleaBayes, we found master regulators and master destabilizers for each subtype. These findings predict targets that may destabilize a particular subtype, including NEv2, and lead to successful therapy, by either knocking out master regulators or turning on master destabilizers."}, {"id": "759_2291", "label": "organism host", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 28, "entity": "Streptomyces", "which_text": "title", "text": "Base editing in Streptomyces with Cas9-deaminase fusions"}, {"id": "759_2292", "label": "genome engineering", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 48, "entity": "Cas9-deaminase", "which_text": "title", "text": "Base editing in Streptomyces with Cas9-deaminase fusions"}, {"id": "760_2290", "label": "not relevant", "start_offset": 649, "end_offset": 662, "entity": "recombination", "which_text": "abstract", "text": "Genetic regulation is achieved by monitoring multiple levels of gene expression, from transcription to protein interaction.

Here we propose to improve the regulation of site-specific integrase-based genetic system by dynamically hiding one of the attB/P sites that are essential for recombination with transcriptional factors. After effectively suppressing excessive recombination, we also validated the necessity of each of the essential components in our transcriptional factor-controlled recombination (TFCR) system. The system applied transcriptional-level regulators directly on controlling the activity of existing non-transcriptional-level trans-factor proteins by inhibiting its binding to the cis-regulatory elements.

Although there has been substantial work on modeling dynamic behavior after circuit construction, the forward engineering of dynamic behavior remains a major challenge. Previous engineering methods have focused on quantifying average behaviors of circuits over an extended time window, however this provides a static characterization of behavior that is a poor predictor of dynamics. Here we present a method for characterizing the dynamic behavior of synthetic gene circuits, using parameter inference of dynamical system models applied to time-series measurements of cell cultures growing in microtiter plates. We demonstrate that the behaviors of simple devices can be characterized dynamically and used to predict the behaviors of more complex circuits. Specifically, we compose 23 biological parts into 9 devices and use them to design 9 synthetic gene circuits in E. coli that provide core functionality for engineering cell behavior at the population level, including relays, receivers and a degrader. We embody our method in a software package and corresponding programming language.

These structural and biochemical studies have suggested that conformational changes and DNA bending in presynaptic complexes underlie site-selection and activation mechanisms of Cre recombinase. Here we used protein engineering and various DNA substrates to isolate the Cre-loxP (54 kDa), Cre2-loxP (110 kDa), and Cre4-loxP2 assembly intermediates, and determined their structures using cryo-EM to resolutions of 3.9 \u00c5, 4.5 \u00c5, and 3.2 \u00c5, respectively. Progressive DNA bending along the assembly pathway enables formation of increasingly intimate protein-protein interfaces. Insufficient stabilization of important protein motifs observed during the assembly process provides a compelling explanation for the observed half-the-sites activity, and preferential bottom strand cleavage of loxP sequences. We found that selection of loxP sites is largely dependent on Cre\u2019s ability to bend and stabilize the spacer region between two recombinase binding elements. Application of 3D variability analysis to the tetramer data reveals a propensity for motion along the pathway between protomer activation and Holliday junction isomerization. These findings help us to better understand loxP site specificity, controlled activation of alternating protomers, the basis for the observed bias of strand cleavage order, and the importance of conformational sampling, especially with regards to site-selection and activity among Cre variants. Furthermore, our findings provide invaluable information for the rational development of designer, site-specific recombinases for use as gene editing technologies. Highlights Cryo-EM structures of Cre-loxP assembly intermediates (monomer, dimer, and tetramer) provide insights into mechanisms of site recognition, half-the-sites activity, strand cleavage order, and concerted strand cleavage Selectivity of loxP sites arises from few base-specific contacts made by each protomer and is mainly driven by formation of phosphate contacts and DNA deformations that are maximal in the fully assembled \u201cactive\u201d tetramer Cis and trans interactions of the \u03b22-3 loop (i) define which sites are \u201cactive\u201d and (ii) ensure half-the-sites activity Protein flexibility plays a central role in enabling DNA sequence scanning, recruitment of a second protein to form a dimer, synapsis, control of activity, as well as subsequent recombination steps Conformational sampling within the tetrameric complex was uncovered using 3D variability analysis and revealed the importance of protein-protein interfaces for site- selection and activation of Cre-loxP complexes\n"}, {"id": "782_2226", "label": "promoter", "start_offset": 91, "end_offset": 96, "entity": "PLsrA", "which_text": "sent_with_neighbors", "text": "The left construct demonstrates the original iGEM part (BioBrick ID: BBa_K117008) with the PLsrA Promoter activating YFPproduction.

These structural and biochemical studies have suggested that conformational changes and DNA bending in presynaptic complexes underlie site-selection and activation mechanisms of Cre recombinase. Here we used protein engineering and various DNA substrates to isolate the Cre-loxP (54 kDa), Cre2-loxP (110 kDa), and Cre4-loxP2 assembly intermediates, and determined their structures using cryo-EM to resolutions of 3.9 \u00c5, 4.5 \u00c5, and 3.2 \u00c5, respectively. Progressive DNA bending along the assembly pathway enables formation of increasingly intimate protein-protein interfaces. Insufficient stabilization of important protein motifs observed during the assembly process provides a compelling explanation for the observed half-the-sites activity, and preferential bottom strand cleavage of loxP sequences. We found that selection of loxP sites is largely dependent on Cre\u2019s ability to bend and stabilize the spacer region between two recombinase binding elements. Application of 3D variability analysis to the tetramer data reveals a propensity for motion along the pathway between protomer activation and Holliday junction isomerization. These findings help us to better understand loxP site specificity, controlled activation of alternating protomers, the basis for the observed bias of strand cleavage order, and the importance of conformational sampling, especially with regards to site-selection and activity among Cre variants. Furthermore, our findings provide invaluable information for the rational development of designer, site-specific recombinases for use as gene editing technologies. Highlights Cryo-EM structures of Cre-loxP assembly intermediates (monomer, dimer, and tetramer) provide insights into mechanisms of site recognition, half-the-sites activity, strand cleavage order, and concerted strand cleavage Selectivity of loxP sites arises from few base-specific contacts made by each protomer and is mainly driven by formation of phosphate contacts and DNA deformations that are maximal in the fully assembled \u201cactive\u201d tetramer Cis and trans interactions of the \u03b22-3 loop (i) define which sites are \u201cactive\u201d and (ii) ensure half-the-sites activity Protein flexibility plays a central role in enabling DNA sequence scanning, recruitment of a second protein to form a dimer, synapsis, control of activity, as well as subsequent recombination steps Conformational sampling within the tetrameric complex was uncovered using 3D variability analysis and revealed the importance of protein-protein interfaces for site- selection and activation of Cre-loxP complexes\n"}, {"id": "803_2178", "label": "organism host", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9, "entity": "ChassiDex", "which_text": "title", "text": "ChassiDex: A microbial database useful for synthetic biology applications"}, {"id": "804_2177", "label": "not relevant", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8, "entity": "Vaccinia", "which_text": "abstract", "text": "Vaccinia virus (VACV) is an established tool for vaccination and is beginning to prove effective as an oncolytic agent.

These structural and biochemical studies have suggested that conformational changes and DNA bending in presynaptic complexes underlie site-selection and activation mechanisms of Cre recombinase. Here we used protein engineering and various DNA substrates to isolate the Cre-loxP (54 kDa), Cre2-loxP (110 kDa), and Cre4-loxP2 assembly intermediates, and determined their structures using cryo-EM to resolutions of 3.9 \u00c5, 4.5 \u00c5, and 3.2 \u00c5, respectively. Progressive DNA bending along the assembly pathway enables formation of increasingly intimate protein-protein interfaces. Insufficient stabilization of important protein motifs observed during the assembly process provides a compelling explanation for the observed half-the-sites activity, and preferential bottom strand cleavage of loxP sequences. We found that selection of loxP sites is largely dependent on Cre\u2019s ability to bend and stabilize the spacer region between two recombinase binding elements. Application of 3D variability analysis to the tetramer data reveals a propensity for motion along the pathway between protomer activation and Holliday junction isomerization. These findings help us to better understand loxP site specificity, controlled activation of alternating protomers, the basis for the observed bias of strand cleavage order, and the importance of conformational sampling, especially with regards to site-selection and activity among Cre variants. Furthermore, our findings provide invaluable information for the rational development of designer, site-specific recombinases for use as gene editing technologies. Highlights Cryo-EM structures of Cre-loxP assembly intermediates (monomer, dimer, and tetramer) provide insights into mechanisms of site recognition, half-the-sites activity, strand cleavage order, and concerted strand cleavage Selectivity of loxP sites arises from few base-specific contacts made by each protomer and is mainly driven by formation of phosphate contacts and DNA deformations that are maximal in the fully assembled \u201cactive\u201d tetramer Cis and trans interactions of the \u03b22-3 loop (i) define which sites are \u201cactive\u201d and (ii) ensure half-the-sites activity Protein flexibility plays a central role in enabling DNA sequence scanning, recruitment of a second protein to form a dimer, synapsis, control of activity, as well as subsequent recombination steps Conformational sampling within the tetrameric complex was uncovered using 3D variability analysis and revealed the importance of protein-protein interfaces for site- selection and activation of Cre-loxP complexes\n"}, {"id": "828_2130", "label": "not relevant", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 44, "entity": "lipolytica", "which_text": "abstract", "text": "The unconventional yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is extensively applied in bioproduction fields owing to its excellent metabolite and protein production ability. Nonetheless, utilization of this promising host is still restricted by limited availability of precise and effective gene integration tools. In this study, a novel and efficient genetic tool was developed for targeted, repeated, and markerless gene integration based on Cre/lox site-specific recombination system. The developed tool required only a single selection marker and could completely excise all of the unnecessary sequences. A total of three plasmids were created and seven rounds of marker-free gene integration were examined in Y. lipolytica. All the integration efficiencies remained above 90%, and analysis of protein production and growth characteristics of the engineered strains confirmed that genome modification via the novel genetic tool was feasible. Further work also confirmed the genetic tool was effective for integration of other genes, loci, and strains. Thus, this study significantly promotes the application of Cre/lox system and presents a powerful tool for genome engineering in Y. lipolytica. Graphical abstractThe novel genetic tool comprised three plasmids, namely, Cre-Y1, Cre-Y2, and Cre-Y3. Cre-Y1 was introduced into the Upleu locus of Po1f, and then recombination between two lox71 sites could remove unnecessary plasmid elements and produce an initial strain harboring a lox71 site. Subsequently, Cre-Y2 was integrated onto the leu2 locus, forming a transitional strain with three lox sites (lox71, lox66, and rclox66). Recombination reactions among these three lox sites could excise unnecessary DNA fragments and retain a lox72 site, an rclox66 site, and a target gene expression cassette in the genome. Similarly, integration of Cre-Y3 produced strains harboring two target gene expression cassettes. Consequently, repeated, targeted, and markerless gene integration could be efficiently realized following iterative integration of Cre-Y2 and Cre-Y3. Highlights A powerful genetic tool was developed for targeted and markerless gene integration The genetic tool was effective for various genes, loci, and strains Only a single selection marker was adequate for repeated gene integration All of the useless and redundant sequences would be excised All integration efficiencies could remain above 90%\n"}, {"id": "829_2129", "label": "not relevant", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 14, "entity": "mathematical", "which_text": "sent_with_neighbors", "text": "A mathematical model based on SalRi/SalRa competitive binding hypothesis was developed, which not only reproduces the observed experimental results but also predict the performance of a new gene circuit design.

Activated macrophages have been shown to produce itaconate, suggesting that these immune cells may employ this metabolite as a weapon against invading bacteria. Here we demonstrate that, in vitro, itaconate can exhibit bactericidal effects under acidic conditions similar to the pH of a macrophage phagosome. In parallel, successful pathogens including Salmonella have acquired a genetic operon encoding itaconate degradation proteins, which are induced heavily in macrophages. We characterize the regulation of this operon by the neighbouring gene, ripR, in specific response to itaconate. Moreover, we develop an itaconate biosensor based on the operon promoter that can detect itaconate in a semi-quantitative manner and, when combined with the ripR gene, is sufficient for itaconate-regulated expression in E. coli. Using this biosensor with fluorescence microscopy, we observe bacteria responding to itaconate in the phagosomes of macrophage and provide additional evidence that interferon-\u03b3 stimulates macrophage itaconate synthesis and that J774 mouse macrophages produce substantially more itaconate than the human THP-1 monocyte cell line. In summary, we examine the role of itaconate as an antibacterial metabolite in mouse and human macrophage, characterize the regulation of Salmonella\u2019s defense against it, and develop it as a convenient itaconate biosensor and inducible promoter system. Importance In response to invading bacteria, immune cells can produce a molecule called itaconate, which can inhibit microbial metabolism. Here we show that itaconate can also directly kill Salmonella when combined with moderate acidity, further supporting itaconate\u2019s role as an antibacterial weapon. We also discover how Salmonella recognizes itaconate and activates a defense to degrade it, and we harness this response to make a biosensor that detects the presence of itaconate. This biosensor is versatile, working in Salmonella enterica or lab strains of Escherichia coli, and can detect itaconate quantitatively in the environment and in immune cells. By understanding how immune cells kill bacteria and how the microbes defend themselves, we can better develop novel antibiotics to inhibit pathogens such as Salmonella."}, {"id": "831_2121", "label": "plasmid", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 35, "entity": "pTKIP", "which_text": "sent_with_neighbors", "text": "The catI gene was cloned from pTKIP-cat which was a gift from Edward Cox & Thomas Kuhlman (Addgene plasmid # 41065; http://n2t.net/addgene:41065; RRID:Addgene 41065).

To explain this phenomenon, we propose an analogy to Ohm\u2019s law in electricity (V=IR) where fitness pressure acts similarly to voltage (V), gene expression to current (I), and resistance (R) to cellular machinery constraints. Lastly, mathematical modelling approaches reveal that the emergent gene expression mechanism requires variation in mRNA and protein production within an isogenic population, and cell \u2018memory\u2019 from positive feedbacks between growth and expression of any fitness-inducing gene."}]
